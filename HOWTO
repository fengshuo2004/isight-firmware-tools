The following steps allow you to have a clean support for Apple
Built-in iSight on both PPC and intel Macintoshes. No kernelspace
Apple driver loading !


 * Install latest isight-firmware-tools.

   /!\ Configure --sysconfdir=/etc (autotools bug?)  in order to have
       the udev rules properly installed.

       	    ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc && make && sudo make install

 * Get any AppleUSBVideoSupport from your Mac OS X partition and
   extract the firmware using ift-extract. ift-extract default output
   to /lib/firmware/isight.fw, so run as root :

            sudo ift-extract --apple-driver AppleUSBVideoSupport

 * Load the firmware manually or reboot

 	    sudo ift-load --firmware /lib/firmware/isight.fw
