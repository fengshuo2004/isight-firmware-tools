Built-in iSight firmware export
*******************************

   ift-export export a Built-in iSight firmware produced by ift-extract
and convert it to Intel HEX file. Note that Apple Built-in iSight seems
to have extende on-chip memory. This case is not handled by fxload and
thus, not allowing to load the Intel HEX file into the chip. Use
ift-load to load directly the binary firmware on-chip.
