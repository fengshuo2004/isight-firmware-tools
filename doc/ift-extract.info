1 Finding the Apple driver
**************************

ift-extract extract Built-in iSight firmware from Apple iSight driver.
This driver is located at
/System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBVideoSupport.kext/Contents/MacOS/AppleUSBVideoSupport
on your Mac OS X root partition.

   There is several version of this driver depending on driver version
or host architecture (PowerPC or x86). Thus, ift-extract must determine
know the variant of the driver in order to properly extract the
firmware.

   Any AppleUSBVideoSupport file starting with those shipped with iMac
G5 iSight must work. If not, please report unknown AppleUSBVideoSupport
at bugreport mail address with machine type and OS X version.
