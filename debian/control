Description: tools for dealing with Apple iSight firmware
 Apple Built-in iSight requires firmware that can be extracted from
 the Mac OS X USBVideo driver. This package provides tools for extracting
 the firmware from the driver and installing udev rules and tools to
 automatically load the firmware when needed.
 .
 A convenient tool for converting firmware binaries to Intel HEX format
 is also provided. This may be required later for use with a
 generic firmware loader such as fxload.
