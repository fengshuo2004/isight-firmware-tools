This project provide tools to manipulate firmware for Built-in iSight
found on Apple machine since iMac G5 iSight (November 2005).

Those tools are based on the work from Ronald S. Bultje and are
licensed under the term of the GPLv2 or later. There are currently
(2010) maintained by Étienne Bersac.

See https://launchpad.net/isight-firmware-tools/ for bugs, code and
more informations.

ift-extract :
—————————————

	ift-extract extracts isight.fw from any AppleUSBVideoSupport
	driver from Darwin. This driver is located in
	/System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBVideoSupport.kext/Contents/MacOS/AppleUSBVideoSupport
	on your Mac OS X root partition.

ift-load :
——————————

	ift-load load a firmware extracted by ift-extract right into
	the iSight. This tool is meant to be called by udev. (see
	isight.rules udev rules file provided).

ift-export :
——————————

	Exports a firmware extracted by ift-extract as Intel HEX
	format for load with fxload. Note that the RAM size of the
	Built-in iSight seems larger than 8KB, therefore fxload refuse
	to load the end of the firmware into the chip.
